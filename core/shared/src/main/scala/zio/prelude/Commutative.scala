/**
 * The `Commutative` type class describes a binary operator for a type `A` that
 * is both associative and commutative. This means that `a1 <> a2` is equal to
 * `a2 <> a1` for all values `a1` and `a2`. Examples of commutative operations
 * include addition for integers, but not concatenation for strings.
 *
 * Commutative operators are useful because combining values with a commutative
 * operation results in the same value regardless of the order in which values
 * are combined, allowing us to combine values in the order that is most
 * efficient and allowing us to return determinate values even when the order
 * of original values is indeterminate.
