/**
 * An `Equivalence[A, B]` defines an equivalence between two types `A` and `B`.
 * These types represent different ways to store the same information.
 *
 * For example, a `List[Byte]` is equivalent to a `Vector[Byte]`. Similarly, a
 * `List[Char]` is equivalent to a `String`.
 *
 * Equivalences are symmetrical. So if `A` is equivalent to `B`, then `B` is
 * equivalent to `A`.
 *
 * @param to   A function that converts an `A` into a `B`.
 * @param from A function that converts a `B` into an `A`.
