ZIO Prelude is an alternative approach to functional abstractions in Scala, which throws out the classic functor hierarchy in favor of a modular algebraic approach that is smaller, easier to understand and teach, and more expressive.

The ZIO Prelude Microsite is currently under development. In the meantime you can check tthe following resources:
